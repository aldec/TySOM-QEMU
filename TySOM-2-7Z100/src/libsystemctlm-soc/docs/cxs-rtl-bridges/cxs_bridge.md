# CXS Bridge Architecture

## Introduction

This document covers the micro architecture details of the CXS Bridge. The
bridge is primarily designed to support the link layer features of CXS
protocol, and generates CXS flits (REQs, DATs, RSPs) based on the register
configuration controlled by the software driver. The CXS bridge does not
implement any hardware caches.

## Features Supported

-   Data widths (cache line size) : 256,512,1024 
-   Control Widths :14,36,44 (it implies MAX_PKT_PER_FLIT from 2 to 4).
-   Number of link layer credits :15
-   Low Power Mode
-   Slave AXI interface: AXI4-Lite, 32-bit Data Width, 32-bit Address width

## Features not supported

-   No Replication
-   No Data Check

## Hardware Block Description:

The CXS Bridge consists of the following sub-blocks:

-   Link layer state machine,
-   Credit managers for transmit and receive channels.
-   Memory for storing transmit and receive Flits and Control information related to Flits.
-   Register block for programming the CXS bridge.

### Clocks

The Bridge IP requires a single clock domain "clk". This clock typically is
connected with XDMA IP's clk for Xilinx use case.

```
The Register block implements the register space as per CXS bridge
requirements. The Register block is accessible via AXI4-Lite interface. The
bridge register space is mapped to one of the PCIE BASE Address Registers
(BARs). The overall memory requirement for bridge is 128KB and depends mainly
on size of the Transmit and Receive CXS channel memories. The register offsets
are defined for each of the registers. The Register block consists of
Programmable Registers, Status Registers and memories for transmitting and
receiving Flits to/from link layer interface. register and memory access from
system side is done through AXI4-Lite interface, where axi transactions has a
AXI4 Slave FSM from which address and data are passed onto the Address Decoder. 

#### Address Decoder

The address decoder block converts the AXI4 transactions into register reads
and writes. The AXI-4Lite transactions are targeted to one of the following
regions of the register space.

-   General Registers: These Registers which are not part of the Data Path of
    CXS Bridge, but are used in Bridge Identification, External interrupts,
    GPIO interface.
-   Protocol Specific Registers: Protocol Specific registers: contain many
    configuration and status registers which pertain to datapath of CXS Bridge
-   Memories: CXS Bridge uses memories for Flit storage where Flits are sent
    from system side to the link layer, and are read over on AXI4-Lite
    interface as Flits are received from link layer interface. This happens only
    when CXS link is UP. Register Block works in close relation to Link Layer
    Interface block as described later. Register Interface also interfaces with
    Interrupt Handler block for Interrupt generation.

#### Transmit and Receive Data CXS Memory Calculation

Maximum Flit Width supported = 1024, For the given width there are 32 32-bit
parallel memories that are 15 deep. Maximum TLP size is 512 Bytes, so both
Transmit and Receive must at least contain, transmit and receive at any given
point of time. However there can be maximum of 15 credits for 15 Flits
sent/received. 15 Flits with multiple TLPs could also be transmitted/received.
So

So max memory requirement for each channel must be according to credit limit
and maximum Flit width = 1024*15= 15K

for Transmit and Receive Channels , the size would be 32K.

For 512 bits, the memory requirement = 16K,

for 256 bits flit width, memory requirement = 8K.

#### Transmit and Receive Control CXS Memory Calculation:

Maximum Flit Control Width = 44 for Flit width of 1024 bits. So there are 2 32
bit-parallel memories that are 15 deep for each channel.

max memory requirement for control channels = 64*15=320 bits.

```
A Central Link Layer state machine keeps running in tune with DUT transmit and
receive CXS signals. The Link Layer interface is tightly coupled with Register
interface. The Link Layer interface implements the link layer of the CXS Layer
where it has a central state machine that controls the transmit and receive
channels. The state machine keeps the link state based on grant/request
mechanism based on the readiness of the upper layers, once the Link comes up,
Flits are exchanged based on credit exchange for Flit transfers and reception.
The Credit Levels for both receive and transmit per channel are maintained in
Credit Manager Block. Upto 15 credits are transmitted and received for receive
and transmit channels respectively. Other auxiliary signals of Cxs layer are
also controlled from Link Layer Interface. The Link Layer Interface works
closely with Register interface into receiving and transmitting Flits from
application layer or the software. The Block Diagram shows the Link Layer
interface block.

#### Link Credit Manager

The Link Credit Manager maintains the number of credits required to
transmit/receive flits on CXS channel. At a time maximum 15 credits can be sent
or received, the credits are implied by virtue of pulse width of CRDGNT
interface of CXS. when the link comes up, a default of 15 credits are sent on
receive channel over CRDGNT output to the DUT . So the internal credit counter
in receive side credit manager is 0. As Flits are received, credits are
incremented in receive side for the given channel and they are decremented when
software programs the ownership_flip register explained later in data flow
description. On transmit side credits are received on transmit channel from DUT
over CRDGNT input signal, so internal credit counter for respective channel is
incremented.When OWNERSHIP_FLIP Register is programmed for a given channel,
Flits are transmitted with which credits are decremented into corresponding
channel credit Manager. It is incremented again when credits are received from
the DUT.

More on the Link Credits management, CXS has an additional interface called
CRDRTN which sends remaining credits to the other side when nothing is to be
sent, remaining credits are received on Receive side. This can be achieved by
programming a bit in the Register asking to send remaining credits.

#### Interrupt Handler

For propagating interrupts from x86 Host to DUT in the FPGA and vice-versa, the
bridge has provision for generating interrupts. Interrupts from Host to the
FPGA DUT are called Host to Card (H2C) interrupts and from FPGA DUT to x86 Host
are called Card to Host (C2H) interrupts.

The H2C interrupts generated by Host can be connected to DUT by using
h2c_intr_out ports. The software driver needs to program C2H_INTR_REG to
generate C2H interrupts. The DUT generated interrupts should be connected to
c2h_intr_in ports. These interrupts can be translated to Legacy/MSI or MSI-X
interrupts over PCIe controller to Host. The Bridge also generates interrupts
to Host for indicating CXS Bridge Receive Transaction occurrences by virtue of
INTR_STATUS_REG with field 0 which indicates occurrence of transaction of event
on any of the Transmit or Receive Channel. Any Error in the received Flit(s)
along with End of Packet is also used for raising Error Interrupt indicated by
virtue of INTR_STATUS_REG with field 1 indicating the occurrence of Error. The
interrupt handler block streamlines the C2H interrupts and its own transaction
event interrupts and forwards to PCIe controller solution. The bridge uses
“irq_out” to generate interrupts and waits for an acknowledgement “irq_ack”
before sending the next interrupt. The “irq_ack” is sent by the PCIe controller
after the “irq_out” translates to a PCIE Legacy interrupt Message TLP on the
PCIe link. The interrupt clear and mask registers control enablement and
disablement of the interrupts as per software’s discretion.
  

#### Link Initialization

The General Data Flow Description describes how Flit flows across the Bridge in
detail. The FLIT width configuration is read initially to help program the
FLITs for transmission and reception. Any configuration from DUT side would be
known beforehand and reflected in the parameters of CXS Bridge. The
BRIDGE_CONFIGURE_REG is set to ‘1’ to initiate the CXS Link Bring up process.
Upon seeing the BRIDGE_CONFIGURE_REG bit set, the link layer state machine
activates and eventually goes to RUN state for both transmit and receive side
and collects credits on transmit channels and sends credits equal to number of
RX_ALLOW_CREDITS(typ.15) from receive channel to/from the neighboring DUT for
all the channels participating. The status of the link and the individual
channel can be checked from CXS_BRDIGE_CHN_TX_STS_REG and
CXS_BRIDGE_CHN_RX_STS_REG.

#### Receiving Flits on Bridge

After the link up, software can receive Flits from DUT which could be any
Read/Write/Snoop Request from upper layer of CCIX contained within the DUT.

The Bridge receives the Data Flit and Control Flit which is stored in the RX
CXS Data Memory and RX CXS Control Memory. The Flit Valid bit is used to set
the RX_OWNERSHIP bit ,side-by-side the bit in INTR_FLIT_RXN_STATUS_REG register
corresponding to RX Flit received is set , the RXDAT_OWNERSHIP bit is set to
‘1’ for the count of the Flit(s) received thereafter too, and an interrupt is
raised by virtue of INTR_FLIT_RXN_STATUS_REG register if
INTR_FLIT_RXN_ENABLE_REG is set. At this point, the credit that is consumed for
Request Flit is not sent back to DUT until the software has read the Data CXS
Flit and the Control CXS Flit.Software upon seeing the interrupt clears the
interrupt bit by virtue of INTR_FLIT_TXN_CLEAR_REG. Thereafter it reads the
data, after which RX_OWNERSHIP_FLIP bit set by software. The FLIP bit resets
the RXDAT_OWNERSHIP register for as many bits set in the FLIP register. Setting
the FLIP bits on also makes the credits consumed in Flit reception be sent back
to DUT.

#### Transmitting Flits on Bridge

After the link is up, software can send Cache Coherency based requests if the
Host is on remote side to downstream remote Cache Interconnect DUT or it can
send response/Data based on requests coming from DUT.

Though for CXS interface there is no distinguishing element, it is sent as Flit
within which TLP{s) are packaged.

Each Buffer is addressable through AXI4-Lite Bus with an offset address meant
for a particular channel. Based on the number of credits available which can be
checked through the CXS_BRIDGE_TXREQ_CUR_CREDITS_REG, The TLP{s) are loaded
into the Transmit CXS Data Memory through AXI4-Lite bus, Along with the TLP(s),
Control information related to packaged TLP(s) is also stored in Transmit CXS
Control Memory. The TLP(s) in parallel access of the Transmit CXS Memory become
a Flit. In order to transmit this over the CXS Transmit channel, software must
set the TX_OWNERSHIP_FLIP bits in the TX_OWNERSHIP_FLIP_REG for the number of
Flits to be sent. Upon sending a Flit, the status bit in
INTR_FLIT_TXN_STATUS_REG. Based on the number of credits available, software
can choose to send more requests. Because of the limitations of the buffer
space within the credit limit of 15, non-continuous mode of transfer is enabled
for both transmit and receive, which means continuous TLP(s) of bigger sizes
can get staggered in receive and transmit based on credit availability.
Example: if Flit Width is 256 and TLP to be transmitted is 512 bytes, which
means 16 credits required, the TLP will not be sent in a single event since the
max number of credits supported is 15.

So , software shall have to check the Credit value and then transmit the
remaining portion, setting the TX_OWNERSHIP_FLIP bits according to the number
of Flits to be sent.

#### Credit Return and Low Power from /to Bridge

When there is no Data/Request to be sent, software can program the
CREDIT_RETURN_TX_REG bit in the CXS_LOW_POWER_REG register to send back the
remaining credits back to the DUT, simultaneously, DUT can also send remaining
credits to the Bridge when there is no Information to be sent from its side.
Thereafter, software can choose to put Bridge on Receive side and thus the DUT
in Low Power by virtue of setting LOW_POWER_RX bit set to '1' in
CXS_LOW_POWER_REG which essentially sends the Low power request to DUT to put
its State machine in Low Power while the local Receive state machine also goes
to Low Power, DEACTIVATE state.

The Transmit side link layer goes to low power only on such request from DUT
through the CXS Low Power CXS_DEACT_HINT signal assertion.

It comes back to normal RUN only when normal link up procedure Flow is
followed.

#### Error Reporting

Any Error response received in the Flits will be raised as an interrupt on
Interrupt Error Status Register called as INTR_ERROR_STS_REG in field ERR_0 ,
An Interrupt will be raised if INTR_ERROR_EN_REG bit 0 is set.

Upon receiving the interrupt, software shall clear the interrupt by setting the
INTR_ERROR_CLEAR_REG bit '0'.
